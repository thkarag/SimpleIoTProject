# SimpleIoTProject
A simple Arduino IoT Project, using the Arduino Cloud.

We use Arduino Cloud to deploy the code, Arduino Nano 33 IoT as microcontroller and DFRobot_BME280 environmental sensor for measurements of Temperature, Humidity, Air Pressure and Altitude.

The DFRobot_BME280 library is located in DFRobot_BME280 directory.
